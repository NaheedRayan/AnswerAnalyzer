Question 1:,Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants. How does it contribute to the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle? Describe the role of chlorophyll in this process.,Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants converts chemical energy in the form of glucose. Here carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. In this way they contribute to the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle.,
Question 2:,What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells? Provide examples of organisms for each cell type and describe their unique characteristics.,"Prokaryotic cells doen't contain distinct 
nucleus and membrane-bond organelles, 
on the other hand eukaryotic cells 
have a well defined nucleus- membrane 
such as mitochondria and endoplasmic
rebiculum.",?
Question 3:,"Explain the process of digestion in humans, detailing the role of different organs and enzymes involved. How is food broken down into nutrients and absorbed by the body?","Digestion happens in the mouth, and then it is broken down mechanically by chewing. Then salava enzymes break docon carbohydrates. Then gastric juice breaks down protein. In this way our! food is broken down.",
Question 4:,Discuss the greenhouse effect and its impact on global climate change. Explain how human activities contribute to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect and suggest measures to mitigate its adverse effects.,"Greenhouse effect causes the temperature 
to increase through out the year.
Access co2 leads to an increase
in temparature. We should plant
more trees to metigate it.",Marks:20
Question 5:,"Explain the principles behind the functioning of a simple electric circuit. Define key components
such as voltage, current, and resistance, and explain Ohm's law. Provide examples of series
and parallel circuits, and discuss their characteristics.","An electric circuit consists of a closed
loop through which electric current
can flow.
Voltage is the difference that
drives the current.
Current is the flow of charge.
Ohm is the resistance.",Marks:30
