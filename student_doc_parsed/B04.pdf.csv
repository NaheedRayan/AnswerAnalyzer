Question 1:,Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants. How does it contribute to the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle? Describe the role of chlorophyll in this process.,"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. During this process, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll pigment present in the chloroplasts of",Marks:10
Question 2:,What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells? Provide examples of organisms for each cell type and describe their unique characteristics.,"Prokaryotic cells lack a distinct nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Examples of prokaryotic organisms include bacteria and archaea, which are unicellular and lack membrane-bound organelles. On the other hand, examples of eukaryotic organisms include plants, animals, fungi, and protists. Eukaryotic cells are typically larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells, with compartmentalization allowing for specialized cellular functions.",Marks:20
Question 3:,"Explain the process of digestion in humans, detailing the role of different organs and enzymes involved. How is food broken down into nutrients and absorbed by the body?","Digestion in humans begins in the mouth, where food is broken down mechanically by chewing and chemically by enzymes like salivary amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates.",Marks:20
Question 4:,Discuss the greenhouse effect and its impact on global climate change. Explain how human activities contribute to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect and suggest measures to mitigate its adverse effects.,"To mitigate these effects, measures such as reducing carbon emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, afforestation, and sustainable land management practices can be implemented.",Marks:20
Question 5:,"Explain the principles behind the functioning of a simple electric circuit. Define key components such as voltage, current, resistance, and explain Ohm's law. Provide examples of series and parallel circuits, and discuss their characteristics.","An electric circuit consists of a closed loop through which electric current can flow. Voltage, measured in volts (V), is the electrical potential difference that drives the current through the circuit. Current, measured in amperes (A), is the flow of electric charge. Resistance, measured in ohms (Î©), is the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit.",Marks:30
